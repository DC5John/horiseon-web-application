## HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

In this project, we were instructed to take the existing code and refactor it in order to make it more accesible. It ensures that the website is user-friendly for people of all abilities and disabilities. We were also instructed to create a repository and properly deploy it to our GitHub pages using git add, git commit, and git push.
